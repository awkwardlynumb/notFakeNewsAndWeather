Not Fake News & Weather is an app usable by anyone to get the information they want when they start their day

This application was created using html&CSS for the front end, as well as javascript for the back end
We used several external technologies like moment.js, JQuery, Bootstrap, Geolocation and a few server-side APIs to fill in the data

# User story
As a human being, I donâ€™t want to get out of bed right when I wake up
I need something on my phone to look at for at least 15 minutes
I need to know the weather as well as current events, along with other facts and knowledge I might want
I would like all of this to be in one easy-to-use app


# APIs to use:
moment.js
geolocation
openweathermap (Current Weather Data, One Call)
numbersAPI.com

Here you can find Today's weather along with an extended five day forecast.

You can use Geolocation that is built into your browser or use the search bar at the top and find the weather for another city.

Below that you can find the top headlines of the day.

We wanted to liven up the page so we added a This Day in History fact to the page as well, unfortunately it broke upon deployment.
