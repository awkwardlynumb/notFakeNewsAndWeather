##Welcome to our News and Weather app.

We've enlisted the use of the following APIs:

* moment js
* numbersapi.com
* openweathermap.org
* Geolocation API
* breaking api

Here you can find Today's weather along with an extended five day forecast.

You can use Geolocation that is built into your browser or use the search bar at the top and find the weather for another city.

Below that you can find the top headlines of the day.

We wanted to liven up the page so we added a This Day in History fact to the page as well, unfortunately it broke upon deployment.
